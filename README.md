# Modular-Meta-Learning-for-Power-Control-via-Random-Edge-Graph-Neural-Networks

Code and tutorial for the results reported in "Modular Meta-Learning for Power Control via Random Edge Graph Neural Networks" by I. Nikoloska and O. Simeone.

The code for a 2-module repository can be found in REGNN+Modular_tutorial.ipynb.

The notebook includes an overview of the proposed method, as well as the code to run the model in the browser. Any further details can be found in the paper.

## Quick run

The easiest way to run the code is to download the notebook, upload to Google Drive, and run it in the browser on Colab. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. The hosted runtime already includes the following dependencies, tested on the following versions in brackets:

Numpy (1.14.6)\
Tensorflow (1.13.1)\
Matplotlib (2.2.4)
Pickle

which are all we need to run the code in this repository.

Alternatively, you can open the .ipynb files using Jupyter notebook. If you do this you will also have to set up a local kernel that includes Tensorflow v1.

This repository will not be maintained.
